properties:
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: GPIO connected to PHY reset signal pin. Reset is active low.
  int-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: GPIO for interrupt signal indicating PHY state change.
  ti,rx-internal-delay:
    type: int
    description:
      RX internal delay setting for the PHY. Required only if interface
      type is PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID or PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_RXID.
  ti,tx-internal-delay:
    type: int
    description:
      TX internal delay setting for the PHY. Required only if interface type is
      PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID or PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_TXID.
  ti,dp83867-rxctrl-strap-quirk:
    type: boolean
    description:
      This flag indicates that the RX_DV/RX_CTRL pin is strapped in either
      mode 1 or 2 in the current target hardware setup. This can cause the
      PHY to get stuck in internal test mode rather than the regular operation
      mode unless the control bit for the test mode is cleared explicitly
      during the initialization of the PHY.
  ti,interface-type:

    description: Which type of phy connection the phy is set up for
    default: "rgmii"
    enum:
      - "rgmii"
      - "rgmii-id"
      - "rgmii-rxid"
